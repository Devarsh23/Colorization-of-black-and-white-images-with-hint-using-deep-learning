# The overview of this repository
Describes about the usefulness of deep learning and computer vision to colorize the black and white pictures with hint <br />
# Motivation behind the project:
The picture without a colour is like a boat without a helm. This sentence specifies the importance of colour in aspect of viewing picture so we decided to perform this project by which we can provide a better alternative coloured image despite of black and white. The added feature, here is that we can give the hint to the various areas to black and white to colour according to that hint. <br />
So, in such situation by using the technology like deep learning  we can help the people in certain public area to colourized their old photos. Hence the aim of this project is to colourized the black and white image. <br />
# To do 
Basically, you can run the colourization.ipynb file after cloning this GitHub repository. <br /> 
If you want to incorporate this with the outer camera the you can add the url + “/video” in the VideoCapture argument to use it on any mobile with ipwebcam or cctv camera. <br />
# Directory Structure
The directory structure here is very simple you just only need to put all the above listed files under one directory 
# Detailed Description of code
# Special Thanks
We would like to thanks krish naik for encouraging us to do such a lovely project of colorization.
